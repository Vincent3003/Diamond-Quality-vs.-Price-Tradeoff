# Diamond Quality vs. Price Tradeoff

**Overview:** 
This project aims to explore and analyze the relationship between diamond quality attributes (cut, color, clarity) and price per carat for customers who have no or little knowledge about diamonds before purchasing one, so he or she can make smart purchases.

**Data:**
The project uses the Diamonds Dataset from Kaggle, containing information about around 54,000 individuals. This dataset includes fields such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, x (length), y (width), and z (depth)


**Methods:**
The analysis workflow includes the following:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Checked for any missing or duplicate values, and added price_per_carat column.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and exploratory analysis to identify the relationship between each variable that can affect the diamond's price.
- Insight-Driven Analysis: Compared price distributions across cut, color, and clarity, and heatmaps to analyze the average price per carat across feature combinations

**Key Results:**
- Best Value Combinations:
    - Cut: "Ideal"
    - Color: E
    - Clarity: SI1 or VS2

**Recommendations:**
- Educate consumers on purchasing diamonds based on their clarity, color, and cut.
- The best option to purchase a diamond is to buy the one has “Ideal” cut with color D or E and any clarity.
- Avoid D color unless paired with IF clarity for investment purposes.
